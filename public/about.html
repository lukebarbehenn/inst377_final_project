    <h1>The Problem:</h1>
    <p>
      The problem I am trying to solve is that Supercell, the creator of the
      mobile video game Clash of Clans, is concerned that the game is losing
      popularity. They may eventually stop updating the game if they believe it
      doesn’t have enough active players. The game has been around for over ten
      years, and as the years have gone by, people have migrated to other
      popular mobile games. The goal of this website is to prove to Supercell
      that the game is still popular and relevant, so they can continue updating
      it.
    </p>

    <h1>What this website does:</h1>
    <p>
      There are three oppurtunites to prove to Supercell that Clash of Clans is
      still popular throughout this website. First the "Player Lookup" page
      provides a way to search for any player in the game, and shows some of
      their stats. The "Top Players" page shows the top 10, 25, 50, and 100
      players currently in the game. Finally, the "Statistics" page shows
      general statistics about the game, such as how many players are currently
      in the game. Using this information, Supercell will see how the game is
      still popular and can continue updating it!
